# Rock Paper Scissors Bot Tournament

Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) Tournament! This project is a fun and competitive way for developers to create bots that will fight each other in a series of RPS matches. The goal is to design the best bot based on its average success rate across all games.

## How it Works

1. **Create Your Bot**: Fork this repository and create a copy of the `template.py` file to create your bot. Your bot should decide on one of the three choices (rock, paper, or scissors) for each match.

2. **Matchups**: Once your bot is ready, submit a pull request with your updated bot. Your bot will then be added to the tournament, where it will compete against other bots in matches.

3. **Leaderboard**: The leaderboard tracks the **average success rate** of each bot across all its matches. The leaderboard is automatically updated as bots compete. Your bot’s rank will reflect its average performance, not just the number of matches won.

4. **Success Rate**: Your bot's score is based on the **average success rate** across all its games. This means consistent performance across matches will help boost your bot's ranking.

## Bot Template

The `template.py` file contains a bot template that you can use as the starting point for your bot. You’ll need to implement the logic to decide your bot’s next move in the `generate_choice()` function.

## Conclusion

This Rock Paper Scissors Bot Tournament is a fun and engaging way to test your bot-building skills and see how well your strategies hold up against others. Whether you're new to programming or an experienced developer, this challenge offers a great opportunity to practice coding and learn from other participants. Remember, the key to success is not just winning individual matches, but maintaining consistent performance across all games. So, get creative with your strategies, keep refining your bot, and most importantly—have fun competing! Happy coding and may the best bot win!
